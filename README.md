# BytesPreview.Maui.Core

BytesPreview.Maui.Core provides an interface for creating for example preview-functionality when selecting a file in a MAUI-application, where the host-program get a view with the content of a byte-array previewed to the user.

This can also be used for a full viewer-program of course.

## Why was this interface made

This interface was originally made to support creating a previewer when selecting a file or other byte-content in the [GenericParameterCollection](https://github.com/HeruEwasham/GenericParameterCollection)'s MAUI-viewer.
